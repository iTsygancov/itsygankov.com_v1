In this article we will take a look at the `datalist` tag, which defines a list of pre-defined options that can be used when typing in a `input` field. Initially this list is hidden and becomes available when the field gets focus or when typing.

This intends it might be utilized as an autocomplete for `input` fields.

Let's look at an example of how to use it:

```html
<label for="car">
  <input list="cars" name="cars" id="car" /> is my favorite car brand!
</label>

<datalist id="cars">
  <option value="BMW"></option>
  <option value="Mercedes"></option>
  <option value="Volvo"></option>
  <option value="Bentley"></option>
</datalist>
```

We have to define `list=""` on our `input`, and then we might define a `datalist` with similar `id` as the `list`.

This will create an `input` with autocomplete functionality.

You can see a working example in action on this Codepen:

## Datalist downsides

The main and major disadvantage is that the user
can enter whatever he wants into the field and we can't
stop him unless we intervene with JavaScript.
