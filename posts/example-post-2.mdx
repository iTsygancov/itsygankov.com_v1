This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React component:

<CodeHighlighter language='javascript'>
const test = 'test';
</CodeHighlighter>

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.
