You can steer clear of many of the errors I made while attempting to figure out
the best syntax highlighting option when you first set out on your path to
implementation. By adding a syntax highlighter, you can make code snippets in
your Next.js application resemble those in your preferred desktop editor. Some
of the highlighters can also significantly slow down client load times and cause
a negative user experience for many. Today, we'll examine a static generation
technique that completes all the work in advance to give the user a quick and
lightweight experience.

The final product will resemble this TypeScript:

<PostCodeHeader>components/ExampleComponent.tsx</PostCodeHeader>

```tsx
interface ExampleComponentProps {
  text: string;
}

const Example = ({ text }: ExampleComponentProps) => {
  return <div>{text}</div>;
};

export default Example;
```

As you can see, the code snippet fits the design of my website, and if I want, I
can also offer alternative designs for dark and light theme.

## Static Syntax Highlighting

### The Tech Stack

We'll be using the following tech stack to create the snippets I use on my blog:

- **Markdown files that are static**. We'll only be using local.md files from
  your Next.js project for this tutorial.
- <a
    href='https://mdxjs.com/'
    target='_blank'
  >
    <strong>MDX</strong>
  </a>
  . a Markdown compiler that enables rendering of JSX, together with customized components.
  This is really powerful.
- <a
    href='https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote'
    target='_blank'
  >
    <strong>next-mdx-remote</strong>
  </a>
  . Lightweight tools that enable Next.js to properly hydrate on the client after
  statically loading MDX.
- Tokenize the code blocks and give stylistic classes, use
  <a
    href='https://highlightjs.org/'
    target='_blank'
  >
    <strong>highlight.js</strong>
  </a>
  or <a
    href='https://prismjs.com/'
    target='_blank'
  >
    <strong>Prism</strong>
  </a>
  .
- The
  <a
    href='https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype'
    target='_blank'
  >
    <strong>Rehype</strong>
  </a>
  plugins that we'll be using for these highlighters are accessible through MDX,
  which also uses Rehype internally.

### Setup

You require a functioning Next.js app with a page on which you want to load the
Markdown content before you can proceed.

<a
  href='https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app'
  target='_blank'
>
  <strong>Create Next App</strong>
</a> can help you launch a beginner project if you're starting from scratch. Install
the dependencies we'll need once this is ready.

```bash
npm i --save next-mdx-remote rehype-highlight
```

**Highlight.js or Prism?** Although all solutions have advantages, we'll be
utilizing Highlight.js for this example. Simply swap out `@mapbox/rehype-prism`
for `rehype-highlight` if you wish to use Prism instead, and then use the Prism
stylesheets in place of the linked Highlight.js stylesheets.

### Adding the Markdown

Begin by generating your first Markdown file! We'll make a `posts` folder in
your Next.js project and add an example blog post to it.

<PostCodeHeader>posts/example.md</PostCodeHeader>

````md
# My Example Blog Post

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

```tsx
const test = 'test';

interface ITest {
  prop: string;
}
```
````

### Serializing the Markdown

We'll use the `getStaticProps` functionality in your Next.js page to send a
collection of props to the main page component. `getStaticProps` is normally
used at build time in production, so if you use it correctly, Next.js will code
split such that none of the dependencies used here are transmitted in client
bundles. Load your Markdown file, then use `next-mdx-remote` to serialize it:

<PostCodeHeader>pages/blog/example.tsx</PostCodeHeader>

```tsx
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize';
import path from 'path';
import fs from 'fs';

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const post = await fs.readFileSync(
    path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts', 'example.md'),
    'utf-8'
  );
  const mdxSource = await serialize(post);

  return {
    props: {
      mdxSource,
    },
  };
};
```

### Rendering the Markdown

You'll now use the `MDXRemote` component to render your serialized MDX.

<PostCodeHeader>pages/blog/example.tsx</PostCodeHeader>

```tsx
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote';

// ...getStaticProps code

const Page = ({ mdxSource }) => {
  return (
    <div className='blog-post'>
      <MDXRemote {...mdxSource} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

If you navigate to `localhost:3000/blog/example`, you should now see the
rendered Markdown content!

<a
  href='https://res.cloudinary.com/deihopdzq/image/upload/v1670959749/itsygankov.com/Next.js%20-%20static%20syntax%20highlighting%20for%20Markdown/1_hmiotv.png'
  target='_blank'
>
  <img
    src='https://res.cloudinary.com/deihopdzq/image/upload/v1670959749/itsygankov.com/Next.js%20-%20static%20syntax%20highlighting%20for%20Markdown/1_hmiotv.png'
    alt='Step 1'
  />
</a>

If your app includes styles for `pre` or `code` tags, you may see those styles
applied, but you cannot style individual syntax tokens at this time. Let's get
that taken care of right away!

### Highlighting the Code

To provide syntax highlighting to the serialized code blocks, we'll now use the
Rehype plugin. Wherever you invoked the serialize() method, make the following
simple change:

<PostCodeHeader>pages/blog/example.tsx</PostCodeHeader>

```tsx
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight';

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  //...
  const mdxSource = await serialize(post, {
    mdxOptions: { rehypePlugins: [rehypeHighlight] },
  });
  // ...
};
```

If you look at the page, you won't notice any instant changes. If you open the
inspector, you'll notice that Highlight.js has now created classes for tokens
within your code block!

  target='_blank'

    alt='Step 1'
  />
</a>

### Adding styles

Navigate to the Highlight.js website's download page. There are several
alternatives available depending on how you want to load your styles. You may
load a stylesheet using their offered CDN, or you can download a CSS file for
your selected theme and load it using Next.js's built-in CSS support (which
enables hot reloading).

If you're downloading a theme, add a global stylesheet to the `pages/_app.js`
file as described in the Next.js manual. It should be noted that this loads the
CSS for the entire app, not just your blog post. If you simply want to apply it
to one page or component, you'll need to look at CSS Modules or a CSS-in-JS
solution.

<PostCodeHeader>pages/_app.tsx</PostCodeHeader>

```tsx
import '../styles/hljs.css';
```

You will see a correctly highlighted code block now that the app understands
what the Highlight.js classes should look like.

    alt='Step 1'
  />
</a>

## Conclusion

Because syntax highlighting at build time provides less flexibility than a
client-side solution, you may have to forego some of the functionality provided
in a tool like

<a
  href='https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter'
  target='_blank'
>
  <strong>React Syntax Highlighter</strong>
</a> to get these speed gains. If the functionalities are insufficient for your needs,
you may switch to utilizing React Syntax Highlighter by following the run time instructions
in the
<a
  href='https://mdxjs.com/guides/syntax-highlighting/#syntax-highlighting-at-run-time'
  target='_blank'
>
  <strong>MDX Syntax Highlighting</strong>
</a> manual. To defer the initial load, use one of the async build optionsâ€”this may
necessitate the use of Next.js's
<a
  href='https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import'
  target='_blank'
>
  <strong>Dynamic Import</strong>
</a>
.

If you only want to show a few lines of lovely highlighted code, this static
export method is a quick and easy way to spice up your snippets.
